      <p>In today’s world, staying focused is harder than ever. Notifications, endless scrolling, and digital noise constantly compete for our attention. Yet, learning how to manage focus is one of the most powerful skills we can develop.</p>

      <h2>1. Understand What Steals Your Focus</h2>
      <p>Before you can regain control, you must know what’s pulling you away. Is it your phone, social media, or multitasking? Once you identify the main culprits, you can create habits to counter them.</p>

      <h2>2. Create a Distraction-Free Environment</h2>
      <p>Focus thrives in calm environments. Try keeping your workspace tidy, silencing unnecessary notifications, and using time blocks where you work without interruptions.</p>

      <h2>3. Practice Mindful Breaks</h2>
      <p>Our brains aren’t designed for constant focus. Instead of working for hours straight, take short, mindful breaks. A quick walk, stretch, or deep breathing exercise can recharge your attention span.</p>

      <h2>4. Build the Habit Gradually</h2>
      <p>Improving focus isn’t instant—it’s a skill built over time. Start with 10–15 minute sessions of deep work, then gradually increase your duration as your mind adapts.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Distraction is part of modern life, but mastery over it is possible. With awareness, discipline, and mindful habits, you can reclaim your attention and achieve more with less effort.</p>
